## Tumor Occurrence in Juvenile Green Turtles (_Chelonia mydas_) </br> in Southern Brazil


**Author: Tawane Yara Nunes**  


#### Background

The green turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, is one of the seven recognized species of sea turtles and is globally classified as endangered. During their life cycle, green turtles are exposed to multiple threats such as pollution, fisheries bycatch, habitat destruction, and the occurrence of diseases. Fibropapilomatosis is a virus-born neoplastic disease most common in green turtles, especially juveniles. Tumor formation by fibropapilomatosis can compromise turtles' locomotion, food ingestion, vision, and reproduction. Investigating this disease is considered a research priority by specialists working in sea turtle biology and conservation.   

#### Goals 

This project aims to: (i) explore the occurrence of fibropapilomatosis tumors (hereafter tumors) and (ii) test if there is difference in the developmental stage between juvenile green turtles afflicted and non-afflicted by tumors, in a foraging ground in Parana State, Southern Brazil.

#### Dataset

The occurrence of tumors in juvenile green turtles was obtained from the [Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação- UFPR]( https://www.lecufpr.net/) database, built in partnership with the [REBIMAR program](https://marbrasil.org/blog/projetos/programa-rebimar/), conducted by Associação MarBrasil. The data was collected through capture-mark-recapture campaigns from 2014 to 2019. All activities were under the Brazilian Scientific Permit from the Ministry of the Environment  SISBIO 74581-6.
